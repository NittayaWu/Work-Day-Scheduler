This app runs in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. 
## Execution

To use the application, the user should open the app on a web browser. Once the day scheduler application is open, the user will see the current date displayed at the the top of the calendar. When the user scrolls down, they can see time blocks for starndard business hours. In each time block, the blocks are color coded to designate wheather it is in the past, present, or future. The past is represented by a gray background, while the present is presented in red and the future hours in greeen. When the user click into a time block text area, they can enter an event. When the user clicks on the save button for that time block, then the text for that event is saved in local storage. When the page is refreshed, then the save events persist.
